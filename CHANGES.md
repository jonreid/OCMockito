Version 1.1.0
-------------
_30 Oct 2013_

**Features:**

- Added MKTArgumentCaptor to capture arguments:

- Convert primitive arguments to objects using NSInvocation+TKAdditions by Taras
  Kalapun.

**Examples & Documentation:**

- Updated examples so they are based on Apple's templates for main target vs. test target. Added
  CocoaPods examples.
- Eliminated DocSet. Documentation will be in the main README and in the OCMockito wiki,
  https://github.com/jonreid/OCMockito/wiki/_pages
