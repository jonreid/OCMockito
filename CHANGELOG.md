-------------
_11 Sep 2016_

**Improvements:**

- Improved reliability of stubSingleton. _Thanks to: Igor Sales_


Version 4.0.0
-------------
_08 Sep 2016_

OCMockito now requires OCHamcrest v6.0.0 or higher. (Actually, it only needs v5.4.0 but v6.0.0
is better for CocoaPods/Carthage users.)

**Features:**

- Added `stubSingleton(…)`. "A patch for the rest of us, who know it's easier to live with the
  reality that singletons are here to stay." _Thanks to: Igor Sales_

**Fixes:**

- Prevent argument captor from capturing values twice.
- Prevent over-releasing mock object that is stubbed as return value for copy method.
- Fixed crash comparing literals to mocked protocols.
- Fixed crash describing collection containing mocked protocol.

**Project changes:**

- Increased deployment targets to OS X 10.9, iOS 8.0.


Version 3.0.2
-------------
_25 Jun 2016_

**Fixes:**

- Fixed race condition when stubbed method is called from multiple threads. _Thanks to:
  brianvanderwal_
- Add transitive imports to OCMockito.h to satisfy new umbrella header requirements.
- Significantly speed up mock creation time. _Thanks to: rcgroot_

**Features:**

- Added Carthage support for Mac, iOS, watchOS and tvOS. _Thanks to: Nikolaj Schumacher_


Version 3.0.1
-------------
_27 Dec 2015_

**Improvements:**

- Improved filtering of call stack to skip past XCTest frames.
- Don't consider previously verified invocations when finding similar invocations.
- When printing invocations, mark previously verified invocations with check marks.


Version 3.0.0
-------------
_21 Dec 2015_

**Compatibility-breaking Changes:**

- The semantics for repeated verification have changed. Call counts used to always accumulate:

```obj-c
…something that invokes someMethod…
[verifyCount(myMock, times(1)) someMethod];
…another thing that invokes someMethod…
[verifyCount(myMock, times(2)) someMethod];
```

But now, verification counts only the matches since the last verification.

- OCMockito now requires OCHamcrest v5.1.0 or higher, which also potentially breaks compatibility.

**Features:**

- Instead of enabling short syntax by defining MOCKITO_SHORTHAND, short syntax is now enabled by
  default. To disable it, #define MKT_DISABLE_SHORT_SYNTAX.
- Previously verified invocations are no longer considered for verification.
- Report additional information about verification failures:
  * If the number of matches is incorrect, report a filtered call stack of the first bad invocation
    or the last good invocation.
  * If there were no matches, but there was a call to the expected method, report it. Describe the
    mismatched arguments along with a filtered call stack.
  * If there were no matches, but there were other calls to the mock, report them with call stacks.
  * If there were no matches, and in fact that mock received no calls, say so.

**Fixes:**

- Fixed `atMost(0)`

**Deleted:**

- `MKTCapturingMatcher` (deprecated in 2.0.1)


Version 2.0.3
-------------
_06 Nov 2015_

**Project changes:**

- Enabling "Symbols hidden by default" in 2.0.2 was overkill, preventing people from using the
  prebuilt Mac framework.


Version 2.0.2
-------------
_24 Oct 2015_

**Project changes:**

- Remove debug symbols from Release configuration, which bloated the libraries and kept folks from
  using the prebuilt iOS framework.


Version 2.0.1
-------------
_14 Oct 2015_

**Compatibility-breaking Change:**

- Eliminated `reset(mock)` since `reset` was likely to clash with mocked methods. Call
  `stopMocking(mock)` instead.

**Fixes:**

- Fixed crash when multiple mock objects are at play on multiple threads.

**Features:**

- Stub void methods with `givenVoid(…)`. _Thanks to: Lysann Schlegel_
- Added `atMost(count)` for `verifyCount()`. _Thanks to: Emile Cantin_

**Improvements:**

- Use `stopMocking(…)` if a `-dealloc` of your System Under Test is trying to message an object that
  is mocked. It disables message handling on the mock and frees its retained arguments. This
  prevents retain cycles and crashes during test clean-up. See StopMockingTests.m for an example.
- NSInvocation+OCMockito.h is now imported by OCMockito.h, so it no longer needs a separate import.

**Deprecated:**

- Deprecated MKTCapturingMatcher; use HCArgumentCaptor from OCHamcrest for capturing arguments.
  There is no need to call -capture to get a matcher to use as the argument, since HCArgumentCaptor
  is a matcher.

**Project changes:**

- Updated project settings to Xcode 7, with tests now run by XCTest.


Version 1.4.0
-------------
_04 Jan 2015_

**Features:**

- Stub sequential returns by chaining `willReturn:`.
- Stub throwing exceptions with `willThrow:`.
- Stub execution of a block with `willDo:`.
- Added support for dynamic properties. _Thanks to Eugen Martynov for example code_
- Added `mockProtocolWithoutOptionals(…)` which mocks an object implementing a given protocol, but
  without mocking any optional methods. _Thanks to: Paweł Dudek_

**Improvements:**

- Updated project to make it run-path dependent.


Version 1.3.1
-------------
_27 Sep 2014_

TPWeakProxy changes:

- Updated to from TPWeakProxy to TPDWeakProxy.
- Directly include a renamed copy to simplify non-CocoaPod builds. Don't call the script
  Frameworks/getweakproxy anymore.


Version 1.3.0
-------------
_04 Jun 2014_

This version requires OCHamcrest 4.0.1.
TPWeakProxy 1.0.0 is also needed to build OCMockito.

- To build OCMockito without CocoaPods, execute two scripts:
  * Frameworks/gethamcrest
  * Frameworks/getweakproxy

**Fixes:**

- Fix `mockClass` crash on 64-bit runtime (OS X and iOS).
- Fixed retain cycle between mocks and tests. The fix addresses most but not all cases. If the
  `-dealloc` of your System Under Test is not called when you nil out your SUT, call `-reset` on
  your mock object (probably from `tearDown`). _Thanks to ronak2121 for testing_

**Features:**

- Stub methods that return structs with `willReturnStruct:objCType:`. _Thanks to
  GWStuartClift and Yaron Inger_
- `stubProperty(instance, property, value)` stubs a property, and its related
  `getValueForKey:` and `valueForKeyPath:` KVO methods. _Thanks to: Sasha Zats_

**Project changes:**

- Increased deployment targets to OS X 10.8, iOS 6.0.


Version 1.2.0
-------------
_05 Apr 2014_

If you're not using CocoaPods, please specify `-ObjC` in your "Other Linker Flags".

**Fixes:**

- Fix crash capturing nil selectors as method parameters. _Thanks to: Sergio Padrino_
- Fix crash capturing inline blocks as method parameters. _Thanks to: Sergio Padrino_
- Fix crash returning BOOL on 64-bit iOS. _Thanks to: Ullrich Schäfer_

**Features:**

- Added support for pointer arguments, including `NSError **`.
- Added support for struct arguments. _Thanks to: César Estébanez Tascón_

**Improvements:**

- To build OCMockito without CocoaPods, execute the script Frameworks/gethamcrest first to get the
  latest OCHamcrest release.


Version 1.1.0
-------------
_30 Oct 2013_

**Features:**

- Added MKTArgumentCaptor to capture arguments:
  * Use `capture` to capture the argument. This must be used inside of
    verification.
  * Use `value` to return the captured value.
  * Use `allValues` to return an array of all captured values.

**Improvements:**

- Changed mock object factory methods to cast to `(id)` to eliminate AppCode warnings.
- Added support for 64-bit iOS devices.
- Convert primitive arguments to objects using NSInvocation+OCMockito by Taras
  Kalapun.

**Examples & Documentation:**

- Updated examples so they are based on Apple's templates for main target vs. test target. Added
  CocoaPods examples.
- Eliminated DocSet. Documentation will be in the main README and in the OCMockito wiki,
  https://github.com/jonreid/OCMockito/wiki/_pages


Version 1.0.0
-------------
_06 Sep 2013_

This release adopts Semantic Versioning (http://semver.org). _Thanks to: Jens Nerup_

**New dependencies:**

- Requires OCHamcrest 3.0.0.

**Features:**

- Handle Class as both argument type and return type. _Thanks to: David Hart_
- Added support for `-isKindOfClass:` to object mocks. _Thanks to: Tim Pesce_
- No more need to specify "Other Linker Flags"! Depending on your project, you may be able to
  eliminate:
  * `-lstdc++`
  * `-ObjC`
* Converted source, tests, and examples to ARC


Version 0.22
------------
_18 Mar 2012_

- Added `mockClass(…)` which mocks a class object. _Thanks to: David Hart_
- Added `mockObjectAndProtocol(Class, Protocol)` which mocks an object of a given class that also
  implements a given protocol. _Thanks to: Kevin Lundberg_


Version 0.21
------------
_09 Mar 2012_

- Added `mockProtocol(…)` which mocks an object implementing a given protocol.
- `given(…)` now supports methods returning float or double. _Thanks to: Markus Gasser_
